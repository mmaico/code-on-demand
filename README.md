## Code on demand
 Simple implementation of Code On Demand based on the [dissertation](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm) on Rest by Roy Fielding.
 
 I'll build a Java application that will receive a JavaScript and will execute this one using Nashorn.

 In node directory have a node application(TypeScript, Webpack, ES5) 



 #### Dev mode
  Into the node folder execute npm run watch:build, the file built will transpile inside the folder 
  src/main/resources/js-node/json-mask.js. Execute node /src/main/resource/js-node/json-mask.js or execute 
  the main class using Java Nashorn
